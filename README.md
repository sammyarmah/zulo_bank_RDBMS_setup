**CASE STUDY FOR ZULO BANK**
This case study provides a comprehensive overview of
the process involved in database and data warehouse
modeling for Zulo Bank, aimed at beginner data
engineers.

It covers the foundational aspects of database design,
including gathering business requirements,
understanding and applying key database principles
such as primary and foreign keys, normalization, and
denormalization, as well as designing schemas.

The study transitions into data warehouse modeling,
focusing on schema transformation, with an emphasis
on the practical application of these concepts to solve
real-world banking data management challenges.

**BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT**
Zulo Bank seeks to overhaul its data
management system to enhance
efficiency, improve data quality, and
enable advanced analytics capabilities. The
current system is plagued with issues
related to data redundancy, inconsistency,
and accessibility, hindering real-time
decision-making and monthly reporting.

Data engineers are tasked with designing a
new system that resolves these issues,
ensuring seamless data integration,
reporting, and analytics.     

**TECH STACK**
A. Python:
Used for data processing, analysis, and synthetic data generation. Python's extensive libraries (Pandas)
facilitate efficient data manipulation for testing and development.

B. SQL (Structured Query Languages)

C. Pgadmin (Postgres Server)

**PROJECT SCOPE**
1. Database Design:
Construct a normalized relational database schema for operational use, covering entities such as
customers, accounts, transactions, and loans. The design process includes identifying primary and foreign
keys, implementing normalization up to the third normal form (3NF), and ensuring data integrity and
efficiency.

2. Data Warehouse Modeling:
Develop a data warehouse schema optimized for analysis and reporting. This involves transforming the
normalized database schema into a star schema, including fact and dimension tables, to support complex
queries and business intelligence needs.

3. Python Programming:
Develop python codes to ingest data, transform it and load it into the PostgreSQL database

4. Version Control:
Carry out good version control practice but using Git Desktop to Push and pull files from our local
repository to git repository
